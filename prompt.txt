Build a minimal blockchain demo for a "Medical Records Access System" using Solidity and the Sepolia test network.

System roles:
- Patient (record owner)
- Doctor (access requester)

Functional requirements:
1. A patient can upload a record (store only metadata — hash, type, timestamp).
2. Patient can grant or revoke doctor access.
3. Anyone can view if a doctor has current access.
4. All actions (upload, grant, revoke, view) must emit blockchain events for audit trail.
5. Use OpenZeppelin Ownable for security if needed.

Technical details:
- Contract name: MedicalRecords
- Use mappings for record ownership and access list.
- Include a `Record` struct with:
  - id (string)
  - hash (string)
  - owner (address)
  - accessList (mapping of doctor address → bool)
  - timestamp (uint)
- Functions:
  - `uploadRecord(string id, string hash)`
  - `grantAccess(string id, address doctor)`
  - `revokeAccess(string id, address doctor)`
  - `checkAccess(string id, address user)` view
- Events:
  - `RecordUploaded(address owner, string id, uint time)`
  - `AccessGranted(string id, address doctor, uint time)`
  - `AccessRevoked(string id, address doctor, uint time)`

Deploy instructions:
- Compile and deploy on Sepolia using Remix + MetaMask.
- Fund wallet with Sepolia test ETH from faucet.
- Test using 2 accounts:
  - Account 1 = patient
  - Account 2 = doctor
- Show on Etherscan: 
  - uploadRecord → event
  - grantAccess → event
  - revokeAccess → event

Goal:
Show an immutable, public audit trail of who uploaded, granted, and revoked access for medical records.
